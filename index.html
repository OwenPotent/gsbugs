    <main>
        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Website not loading / responding</h3>
        <p>
            The website's slowed due to images loading more often per user, a total of 64 request/users visit the
            website every second, during the opening I could tell the website crashed since it took me around 3 seconds
            for the server to load clearly, 3 seconds is a lot, and the users are making a traffic out of it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Login Page</h3>
        <p>
            The login page was not supposed to be visible to customers, its purpose is meant for users who are chosen by Wolfie.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Website Layout Not Working Properly</h3>
        <p>
            When you load the website, you might encounter buggy content such as overlayed images, weird navigation bar, bigger images,
            search bar and so on. This is due to the website having problems responding to certain devices.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Some Pages Showing Up On Search</h3>
        <p>
            As you search using the "search bar" feature, you might encounter some pages that weren't meant to be shown, e.g. Privacy Policy, 
            FAQ, Contact Us.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Dummy Text On Asset Page</h3>
        <p>
            When loading an asset page, you may find "Lorem Ipsum", or dummy texts on the description and others.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Billing Details</h3>
        <p>
            At the moment, when trying to download an asset, you are prompt to enter your name and phone number.
            This should not happen but will be fixed soon.
        </p>

        <h3 class="bug-title">➡️ Others</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> - The website might break if you use a dark-mode chrome extension, e.g Dark Reader.</li>
                <li> - 404 pages will sometime appear but that shouldn't be a problem.</li>
                <li> - Website might load a normal layout due to the traffic overflow of the server.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
